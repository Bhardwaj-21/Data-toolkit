        "\n",
        "1. Efficient Arrays**: Provides fast, flexible arrays (`ndarray`) for numerical data.\n",
        "2. **Performance**: Operations are faster than regular Python lists due to C-based implementation.\n",
        "3. Mathematical Functions**: Offers functions for linear algebra, statistics, and more.\n",
        "4. Integration**: Works well with other libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Shape Compatibility: For broadcasting to occur, the dimensions of the arrays must be compatible. This means:\n",

        "\n",
        "- Align dimensions: NumPy aligns the dimensions of both arrays from the right.\n",
